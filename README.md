# EcoType-Forest-Cover-Classification
This project predicts forest cover types including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model comparison, and hyperparameter tuning. Random Forest achieved 96% accuracy and was deployed in a Streamlit app, enabling real-time forest type prediction through interactive user inputs and automated machine learning workflow.
